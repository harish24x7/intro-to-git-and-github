The git init command creates a new Git repository. In our case, it transformed the current directory into a Git repository. It can also be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or to initialize a new, empty repository.

Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository. This metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. A HEAD file is also created which points to the currently checked out commit.

If you've already run git init on a project directory containing a .git subdirectory, you can safely run git init again on the same project directory. The operation is what we call idempotent; running it again doesn't override an existing .git configuration.

The command git commit with -m flag takes the commit message, too. This is different to the command without flag, where you had to type the commit message within the editor. If multiple -m flags are given to the command, it concatenates the values as separate paragraphs.

Git log command shows the commit history of the repository. It shows all the commits on the repository represented by a unique commit ID at the top of each commit. It also shows the author, date, and time and the commit message associated with the commits.

You also have various options to limit the output of this command. The output can be filtered based on the last number of commits, author, commit message, etc.
