Any Git project will consist of three sections.
The Git Directory
The Working Tree
Staging Area. 

IN DETAIL:

The Git directory contains the history of all the files and changes. The working tree contains the current state of the project, including any changes that we've made. And the staging area contains the changes that have been marked to be included in the next commit.

If a file is in the modified state, it means that we've made changes to it that we haven't committed yet. The changes could be adding, modifying or deleting the contents of the file. Git notices anytime we modify our files. But won't store any changes until we add them to the staging area. So, the next step is to
stage those changes. When we do this, our modified files become stage files. In other words, the changes to those files are ready to be committed to the project. And finally, when a file gets committed, the changes made to it are safely stored in a snapshot in the Git directory. This means that typically a file tracked by Git, will first be modified when we change it in any way. Then it becomes staged when we mark those changes for tracking. And finally it will get committed when we store those changes in the VCS.
