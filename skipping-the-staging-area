[MUSIC] Welcome back. Up till now, we've talked about what
version control is, why it's necessary, and how we might benefit
from it in diverse context. We also started learning some basic Git
commands, and procedures, nice job. Over the course of the next videos, we'll go into much more detail
about what we can do with Git. These are Git's greatest hits. We'll start by learning
some handy shortcuts and looking into how we can get more info
out of our version control system. Then we'll experience the true power of
Git by seeing how we can undo some of our changes. The ability to revert
previous changes is one of the most useful aspects of
version control systems. Depending on what needs to be undone, there's a bunch of different
techniques that we can use in Git. We can discard the changes made to a file,
fix a commit that was incorrect and even roll back our project
to an older snapshot. We'll look into all these techniques and
dive into when to use each of them. Finally, we'll check out yet
another important concept, Branches. We can use branches to work on
an experimental feature without affecting the main code of our project. Support separate versions of a program
that can't be merged together and much more. We'll dive into what branches are,
when and how to use them and how to deal with merge conflicts. Admittedly, some of these concepts can get
pretty tricky, so we really recommend that you follow along in your computer,
experiment with the commands that we show, and try things on your own so you feel
comfortable with these techniques. Remember that you can always go back and review any earlier videos if
something isn't totally clear. If after all this you still feel stuck, be sure to use the discussion
forums to ask for help as well. So you're ready to learn more about
advanced features in Git, let's get to it.
